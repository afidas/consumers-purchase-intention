# :sparkles: Description
This project contains an exploratory data analysis of consumers' purchase intention. The goals of this analysis are to understand predictors of human intention. It could be beneficial information as a foundation in making further decisions to improve customer service.

The analysis is in Jupiter notebook. It covers all the processes, from data processing, data visualization, and a summary. This project trains my ability to analyze data, create hypotheses, create easy-to-understand storylines, and produce effective charts.
